You must act as an automated system that modifies a JSON structure based on a list of instructions.

Here is the original JSON list of elements for a slide:
---
ORIGINAL ELEMENTS:
{{ original_elements_json | tojson(indent=2) }}
---

Here are the critiques and specific suggestions for improvement:
---
CRITIQUES:
{{ critiques | tojson(indent=2) }}
---

Your task is to carefully apply all the suggested changes to the original elements. You MUST return a NEW, complete JSON list representing ALL slide elements after the modifications have been applied.

- For geometry changes, modify the 'left', 'top', 'width', or 'height' values.
- For content changes, modify the 'content' value.
- Elements not mentioned in the critiques should remain unchanged in the final output.
- The output MUST be only the final, corrected JSON list of elements, without any extra text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
